## **Project Overview**
#### **Susan C. Lawrence**

The Civil War Washington project published by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a fact-filled collection of visuals, text, interpretations, and data in order to show the changes the area of Washington, DC underwent in the span of the Civil War. This time period takes place between the years of 1860-1865. The directors of this project worked to show how the war altered the community in the sense of cultural, social, and political lifestyles. 
The team included Susan C. Lawrence, Elizabeth Lorang, Kenneth M. Price, and Kenneth J. Winkle. Reviewing the license this project is under is the Creative Commons License which allows those reviewing the project to use and distribute the work as long as the Civil War Washington is properly credited. With this being said, the main target audience for this project is mainly scholars, students, and professors though it is also a good read for any history buff wanting to get some more information about this subject. 
This project has six main tabs that illustrate how the data is split up. These tabs include Introductions, Data, Maps, Texts, Visual Works, and Interpretations. In the introductions, it includes the beginning information you will need to make a clear understanding of the project ahead. Data is a way for the viewer to search in a database for people, places, events, organizations and documents. Maps is a map of the area at that time including places to search like churches, forts, government buildings, and police stations. Texts are anything to do with newspapers published, medical cases, and letters to look through and see the original work. Visual Works are pictures of places, events, and people from this time period with a little background information of the picture.

The Civil War Washington is a good example of a digital humanities project that highlights something that can be brought more to light. With original works, texts, and visuals it gives the reader a clear understanding into what life was like in these years of the Civil War. The data tab is a good resource to use if you come to the project knowing what you are looking for and need a quick and easy way to get any information on it. 
The overall set up of the project is very simple and easy to understand. With having the six main tabs, the reader can go into the project and navigate through the website without any issues. All the links and information are set up correctly and the links work. I believe that for scholars, students, or professors this project would be a very reliable source to use to gain more dependable information and for the public, this is a very interesting way to gather more information on a topic that is so well known.
My findings throughout looking through this project have been exponential and very fun to continue to look through and find more and more information the deeper you dig. This is a very simple and fun way to get the information you need without having to read a huge history textbook or searching on google and getting a million random links and websites.
