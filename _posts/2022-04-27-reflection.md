  When I first signed up for this class I was not aware of how much it would impact myself as a writer and overall student. I knew I needed it for my last requirement for my minor and I was ready to just get school over with and skim by however I could. However, with each project and assignment, I found myself challenging myself and altering the way I approached different writing techniques. I began being more critical of myself, diving deeper into the editing process of a first draft, and finding new ways to analyze and understand readings. I believe that this class has helped me to slow down and take the necessary steps to comprehend what needs to be done and make sure that I am writing in a way that will get my point across effectively. 

## Definition
Since digital humanities is my minor, I have had the chance to take related courses to digital humanities and form my definition prior to entering this class. However, the more I study the term and take part in assignments that involve it, my definition gets a little clearer to me. I began this class by saying that digital humanities was a way to observe, relate, and illustrate to others a concept that is happening and an underlying meaning. With the progression of this semester, I have altered my definition of digital humanities a little. I now believe that digital humanities is not only a way to understand what is happening and get the underlying meaning, but also is another technique for diving deeper into the literature and/or work so that the reader can have a different approach to reading and understanding the work. Below is my new definition I wrote just last week.

## Readings
With each week, Dr. Stover gave us readings to help us with the topics and assignments we are working on in that week. Each reading assignment always gave me a new perspective and a helpful stance on what needed to be done. I believe that my favorite reading assignment for myself as a student was the Reviews in Digital Humanities. Although this is not an article or a set reading we had to read. It gave the students a chance to get examples of what proper reviews of projects look like before we began our own review of our project. I believe that as a writer and student, I like to go into assignments with a clear and concise understanding of what needs to be done and seeing those real life examples always starts me off on the right track with knowing what it should look like. Below is a snapshot of the website and you can see just how many options and more there were to look at which gave me an even better understanding of what needed to be done.

## Assignments
The assignments this year have been incredibly intriguing. I believe that whenever a new assignment was introduced, I was always super overwhelmed. However, with the help from Dr. Stover’s instruction and the readings I was always able to navigate through them and turn in something I was proud of. My favorite assignment this semester was definitely the Grant Proposal. This assignment challenged me so intensely. I was going through a rough couple of weeks and found myself feeling very behind in all of my classes during this time so the Grant project really overwhelmed me. However, when I got back on my feet and got to meet with Dr. Stover to go over my rough draft I was able to really see what needed to be done for it. I found myself very proud and content with the final draft I turned in and think I really nailed it, which was such a feeling of relief and accomplishment. Besides the feeling of contentment, I really just enjoyed being able to use our own creativity and inspiration for what we wanted to do our project on. This created an immediate sense of excitement for what I was writing about since I got to choose what interested me to begin with. 

## Self-Reflection
Like said above, I believe that this course has helped me immensely in the writing and overall student field. I know that after taking this class, I will have the proper experience to know how to produce a writing piece worth reading. With that experience, I know what works for me and what doesn’t from this class. I know that I am a writer that cannot hash out everything all at once, I need to write something out, sit back, and come back to it with a fresh mind. I know that by taking this class, anything I write in the future will be better than if I wrote it without taking this course.
